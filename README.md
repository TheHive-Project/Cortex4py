# Cortex4py
Cortex4py is a Python API client for [Cortex](https://thehive-project.org/), a powerful observable analysis engine where observables such as IP and email addresses, URLs, domain names, files or hashes can be analyzed one by one using a Web interface.

Cortex4py allows analysts to automate these operations and submit observables in bulk mode through the Cortex REST API from alternative SIRP platforms and custom scripts.

# Use It
On macOS and Linux, type:
```
sudo pip install cortex4py
```

Following is an example of a Python script that runs an analysis using MaxMind analyzer:

```python
import sys
import json
from cortex4py.api import CortexApi
from cortex4py.api import CortexException

api = CortexApi('http://127.0.0.1:9000')

# Run analysis
job_id = None
try:
    response = api.run_analyzer("MaxMind_GeoIP_3_0", "ip", 1, "8.8.8.8")
    job_id = response["id"]
except CortexException as ex:
    print('[ERROR]: Failed to run analyzer: {}'.format(ex.message))
    sys.exit(0)

# Get the job report
try:
    response = api.get_job_report(job_id, '30s')
    print(json.dumps(response, indent=4, sort_keys=True))
except CortexException as ex:
    print('[ERROR]: Failed to get job report'.format(ex.message))
    sys.exit(0)
```

If you are using Python on a Windows operating system, please forgo the `sudo` command.
